Dev Notes
=========

About
-----

Dev Notes is a collection of "best" practices that I have come across. Whether
or not they are actually the best, is a decision left up to the reader. This 
guide will attempt to catalogue and organize processes I follow both frequently 
and infrequently and will allow me to look back and see how I did something and 
possibly determine *why* I did something.

Contributing
------------

If you see a glaring misconfiguration, a horribly inefficient algorithm, security
risks, or anything else you'd like to fix. Feel free to submit a pull request on
GitHub.
